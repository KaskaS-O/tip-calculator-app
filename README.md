## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first challenge requiring more js. Handling different sources of data (Tip form) wasn't easy at first. The design of an app required live calculating of and values (Tip per person, Amount per person) which has some difficulties.

### Continued development

I think this app would be good opportunity to practice OOP. It would allow to create more universal functions and components.
